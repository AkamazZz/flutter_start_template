# Flutter Starter Project with Clean Architecture

Welcome to the Flutter Starter Project! This starter project has been designed to provide a solid foundation for your Flutter application development, following a clean architecture approach. Our goal is to reduce boilerplate code, offer clear examples for feature implementation, and provide core utilities and helpers to accelerate your development process.

## Key Features:

### Clean Architecture:
The Flutter Starter Project is organized using a clean architecture approach, separating your codebase into distinct layers to promote maintainability and scalability. This architecture consists of:

- **Presentation Layer**: This layer includes UI components and widgets. It is responsible for rendering the user interface and handling user interactions.

- **Domain Layer**: The domain layer defines the business logic and use cases of your application. It is independent of the data source and presentation logic.

- **Data Layer**: The data layer handles data sources, such as APIs or databases. It communicates with the domain layer to provide data and services.

### Feature Examples:
We have provided comprehensive examples for various features commonly found in Flutter applications

### Core Utilities and Helpers:
We have included a set of core utilities and helper classes to ease your development journey. Some of the essentials provided are:

- **Network Utilities**: Handling network requests and API integration.

- **Localization Support**: Manage localization and internationalization of your app  using Intl and IntlUtils.

- **Database Integration**: Utilize local storage with preferred databases.

- **Error Handling**: Handle errors gracefully throughout your application.

### Reduced Boilerplate with BLoC:
We've incorporated BLoC (Business Logic Component) to manage state in your Flutter application. Our starter project reduces the boilerplate code associated with BLoC by providing ready-to-use templates and best practices for state management.

## Getting Started:
